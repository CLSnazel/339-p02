			<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
			<p class="alone">
				Flannels Ultd started in 1997 as a small store in the Vancouver area. Over the years, the famous plaid pattern and the flannel shirt have consistently been a staple for fashion. Using quality, woven fabrics and original designs, Flannels Ultd strives to be the very best, like no one ever was. To make our customers our beloved garments is our real test, and to watch them enjoy and live in their flannels is our cause. That’s why we tailor each garment to fit our customers perfectly, so that we can include every-BODY. Now with the rapid expansion of the internet we can send our garments far and wide using our online store.
